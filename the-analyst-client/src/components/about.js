            <h2> About This Site</h2>
            <p>This site is the final project for Tyler Hueter as he completes the 15 week Web Immersive bootcamp.
                The purpose of this site would be to guide individuals to read news stories from sources they would not normally go to.
                Through that people can help determine their own personal preferences/bias and to crowdsource a bias reading for different news sources.
            </p>
            <h2>About the Author</h2>
            <p>Tyler Hueter has worked in several and varied industries, including non profit performing arts, politics, and most recently transportation.
                As the managing partner in a Taxi company in Charleston, he whitnessed first hand the disruptive and transforative abilities of technology.
                And as small businesses in the transportation industry are closing rapidly, he chose to be on the forefront of change before becoming a victim of it.
                Hope you enjoy the project!
